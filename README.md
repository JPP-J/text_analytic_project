This repo is home to the code that accompanies Jidapa's *Text Analytic Project* , which provides; 
- [Text classification and Clustering report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hwf-yAWtEjgi-CYBG3U80RKYMJwHa6mS/view?usp=sharing) in Python code and Rapid Miner processes with text processes tokenize, stemming, remove stop word and convert to vector like TF-IDF, Term occurrence:
  - Python code
    for classification and clustering data with:
    - K-mean algorithms for clustering
    - Naive-Bayes for classification 
    - k-NN for classification
    - SVM for classification
  - Rapid miner for classification and clustering data with:
    - K-mean algorithms for clustering
    - K-medoids algorithms for clustering
    - Naive-Bayes for classification 
    - k-NN for classification
    - SVM for classification
  - Provides:
    - [text_setting.py](text_setting.py) : Set up token vector of word to use in next process 
    - [text_exploration.py](text_exploration.py) : Exploration word in each category before analysis
    - [python text_clustering.py](text_clustering.py) : Get into text analysis process on clustering task
    - [python text_classification.py](text_classification.py)  : Get into text analysis process on classification task
    - [text_clsf_usage_model.py](text_clsf_usage_model.py) : Usage model from classification task to use later trained model
